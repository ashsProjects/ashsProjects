### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ash and you've found my personal repo! Feel free to look through and possibly star if you found it helpful or interesting. I am interested in all Computer Science and have various projects in algorithms, front-end development, back-end development, machine learning, and generally fun projects. I hope to enter the industry after graduating as a full-stack engineer.
